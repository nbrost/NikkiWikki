        <h2>Introductory Speech</h2>
        <p>
            Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Blackwood Estate. I am Jeeves, the butler, and I will be assisting you throughout the night. Our esteemed host, Dr. Evelyn Blackwood, is currently attending to some last-minute preparations in her study. She has asked that you all gather here in the drawing room for a special announcement she calls 'The Revelation.'
For those of you who may not be familiar with Dr. Blackwood, allow me to provide a brief introduction. Dr. Evelyn Blackwood is a brilliant and eccentric scientist who has made her fortune in the biotech industry. Known for her groundbreaking research in genetics and her controversial experiments, she has pushed the boundaries of ethics and legality in her relentless pursuit of knowledge.
Each of you here tonight has a unique connection to Dr. Blackwood, whether it be through business, personal relationships, or even chance encounters. She has carefully selected this group of individuals to be present for her 'Revelation,' an event she has been planning for quite some time.
While some of you may be acquainted with one another, others may be meeting for the first time. To help break the ice and foster a sense of camaraderie before Dr. Blackwood joins us, I suggest we begin with a round of introductions.
Please, feel free to share a bit about yourself, and perhaps your occupation. This will give everyone a chance to get to know one another and may even shed some light on the purpose of tonight's gathering.
So, who would like to start? Remember, this is an opportunity to make a lasting impression on your fellow guests, so don't be shy! Once everyone has had a chance to introduce themselves, we'll settle in and await Dr. Blackwood's arrival and the commencement of 'The Revelation</p>

        <h2>Mrs.Blackwood missing</h2>
        <p>
            Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the delay, but Dr. Blackwood seems to be taking longer than expected. As her trusted butler, I find this highly unusual. If you'll excuse me, I will go check on her in her study. Please remain here, and I will return shortly with an update.
        </p>

        <h2>Body Found</h2>
        <p>
            I'm afraid I have some terrible news. Upon entering Dr. Blackwood's study, I discovered her body. It appears that she has been murdered. I have already contacted the authorities, but we must all remain here until they arrive. In the meantime, I suggest we work together to try to piece together what may have happened and who among us might be responsible for this heinous act. In the mean time I will further investigate the crime scene.

        <h2>Hints to give to Guests</h2>
        <p>
            You, as the butler, can mention to Professor Penelope Poe that you overheard an argument between Dr. Blackwood and Mr. Binsworthy a few days before the murder. They were discussing a disagreement over a joint research project, and Dr. Blackwood threatened to expose Mr. Binsworthy's unethical business practices if he didn't cooperate.
        </p>
        <p>
            you saw Madam Flora Cruz arguing with Dr. Blackwood on the night of the murder. Madam Cruz seemed agitated and was overheard saying, "You can't keep using me like this, Evelyn. I won't be a part of your twisted experiments anymore."
        </p>
        <p>
            I witnessed Big Tony and Captain dick having a serious headed discussion earlier, but when I approached they hushed up and seperated. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the evening, you, as the butler, can take aside a few guests and confide in them about Dr. Blackwood's concerns regarding Professor Poe and the artifact. - You can mention that Dr. Blackwood had expressed to you her growing suspicions that Professor Poe was becoming obsessed with the artifact's dark powers and might be planning to use them for nefarious purposes. - You can share that Dr. Blackwood had told you she was considering taking steps to prevent Professor Poe from accessing the artifact, fearing that she might steal it and conduct her own twisted experiments.

        <h2>Revelation</h2>
        <p>
            Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please. As we come to the end of this tragic evening, it is my duty to shed light on the truth behind Dr. Blackwood's untimely demise.

Throughout the night, we have uncovered a web of secrets, lies, and hidden agendas surrounding our esteemed host and her groundbreaking research. We have followed the clues, pieced together the evidence, and confronted the dark truths that lay beneath the surface.

It is with a heavy heart that I must reveal the identity of the person responsible for Dr. Blackwood's murder. The culprit, I'm afraid, is none other than Mr. Binsworthy.

The evidence against him is damning. We have discovered the incriminating documents linking him to the illegal activities surrounding Dr. Blackwood's research. We have heard the testimony of those who witnessed his heated arguments with Dr. Blackwood in the days leading up to her death. And we have uncovered the shocking truth about his desperate financial situation and the lengths he was willing to go to protect his crumbling empire.

Mr. Binsworthy, driven by greed and the fear of losing everything, made the fateful decision to silence Dr. Blackwood permanently. He saw her as a threat to his power and wealth, and in a moment of desperation, he took her life.

But even in the face of this terrible truth, we must remember the brilliance and passion of Dr. Evelyn Blackwood. She dedicated her life to the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of humanity. Her legacy will live on through the groundbreaking discoveries she made and the countless lives she touched.

As we move forward from this tragedy, let us honor Dr. Blackwood's memory by continuing her work and striving to build a world free from the darkness of greed and deception. Let us stand together in the face of adversity and fight for the truth, no matter the cost.

Thank you all for your courage and determination in unraveling this mystery. May justice be served, and may Dr. Evelyn Blackwood rest in peace.
