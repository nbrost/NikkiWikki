        <h2>Introductory Speech</h2>
        <p>
            Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Blackwood Estate. I am Jeeves, the butler, and I will be assisting you throughout the night. Our esteemed host, Dr. Evelyn Blackwood, is currently attending to some last-minute preparations in her study. She has asked that you all gather here in the drawing room for a special announcement she calls 'The Revelation.'
For those of you who may not be familiar with Dr. Blackwood, allow me to provide a brief introduction. Dr. Evelyn Blackwood is a brilliant and eccentric scientist who has made her fortune in the biotech industry. Known for her groundbreaking research in genetics and her controversial experiments, she has pushed the boundaries of ethics and legality in her relentless pursuit of knowledge.
Each of you here tonight has a unique connection to Dr. Blackwood, whether it be through business, personal relationships, or even chance encounters. She has carefully selected this group of individuals to be present for her 'Revelation,' an event she has been planning for quite some time.
While some of you may be acquainted with one another, others may be meeting for the first time. To help break the ice and foster a sense of camaraderie before Dr. Blackwood joins us, I suggest we begin with a round of introductions.
Please, feel free to share a bit about yourself, and perhaps your occupation. This will give everyone a chance to get to know one another and may even shed some light on the purpose of tonight's gathering.
So, who would like to start? Remember, this is an opportunity to make a lasting impression on your fellow guests, so don't be shy! Once everyone has had a chance to introduce themselves, we'll settle in and await Dr. Blackwood's arrival and the commencement of 'The Revelation</p>

        <h2>Mrs.Blackwood missing</h2>
        <p>
            Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the delay, but Dr. Blackwood seems to be taking longer than expected. As her trusted butler, I find this highly unusual. If you'll excuse me, I will go check on her in her study. Please remain here, and I will return shortly with an update.

        <h2>Body Found</h2>
        <p>
            I'm afraid I have some terrible news. Upon entering Dr. Blackwood's study, I discovered her body. It appears that she has been murdered. I have already contacted the authorities, but we must all remain here until they arrive. In the meantime, I suggest we work together to try to piece together what may have happened and who among us might be responsible for this heinous act.
