        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Madam Flora Cruz, a 42-year-old anesthesiologist, leads a double life. By day, she is a respected healthcare professional, known for her expertise in administering anesthesia. However, behind closed doors, she engages in a lucrative and illicit side business, siphoning off excess vials of anesthesia and selling them on the black market.

            Madam Cruz's clientele ranges from thrill-seekers to those with nefarious intentions. She maintains a network of contacts in the criminal underworld, always staying one step ahead of the authorities. Despite the risks, she finds a strange thrill in leading this double life, justifying her actions by the financial rewards it brings.
            
            However, beneath the surface, Madam Cruz is haunted by the moral implications of her choices.

The weight of her guilt grows heavier each day, but the lure of the black market keeps her entangled in this dangerous web.
            
            As she navigates the complexities of her dual existence, Madam Flora Cruz must constantly be on guard, knowing that one misstep could expose her secret and bring her carefully constructed world crashing down. She lives with the knowledge that her secret could be revealed at any moment, risking her career, her freedom, and the trust of those who depend on her.

        <h2>Introduction Speech</h2>
        <p>Good evening, everyone. I am Madam Flora Cruz, a distinguished anesthesiologist with a secret. While I dedicate myself to ensuring the safety and comfort of my patients during surgical procedures, I also lead a shadowy double life.

            In the depths of the black market, I trade in excess vials of anesthesia, turning my medical expertise into a lucrative side business. The thrill of the illicit and the financial rewards have a powerful hold on me, despite the moral burden I carry.
            
            I am constantly aware of the risks I take, knowing that one misstep could expose my secret and bring my world crashing down. The consequences of my actions weigh heavily on my conscience, but the allure of the forbidden keeps me ensnared in this dangerous dance.
            
            Before you stands a woman with a foot in two worlds - a healer by day and a dealer by night. Judge me if you will, but know that the path I walk is a treacherous one, filled with secrets and moral dilemmas that I must navigate alone.
