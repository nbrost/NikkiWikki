        <h2>Matching on Bumble</h2>
        <p>I don't remember a lot about our initial conversations or how I managed to get such a cutie to meet up with me, but one thing I do remember was her quote in her bio "The Only Way Out is Through" and getting her to explain what it meant to her.</p>

        <h2>Our First Date</h2>
        <p>March 12th 2023 was our first date. I showed up dischevelled after having spent the night at the beer fest with Noah, Ethan, Fraser, and Kyle. Nicole showed up gorgeous as ever, I remember being suprised by how small and adorable she was, and her curly hair was definitely on point that day. We met at remedy cafe and got to know each other over chai. She showed me some of her tattoos and despite my best efforts she declined my offer to go to a used book sale with me. I had such a great time after I had to tell Fraser about it </p>

        <h2>Our Second Date</h2>
        <p>On our second date we went to Malt and Mortar where we shared brussel sprouts (which were delicious) and I got a Flying Purple Pea Flower Sour Saison. Afterwards we decided to check out a used book store where we made fun of the covers on old romance books, talked about some of societies injustices, and got to know each other some more. I don't remember much more of what we discussed but I remember leaving the date thinking I needed to get to know Nicole more.</p>

        <h2>Third Date</h2>
        <p>On our third date Nicole invited me to her house to have dinner and play N64 together. We played a single cup of mario kart 64 (she narowly came back to beat me) and a round of Mario Party (I can't remember which) where I thouroughly kicked her ass.</p>

        <h2>NGHTMRE</h2>
        <p>Exactly one month after meeting Nicole we went to see NGHTMRE at union hall. We spend the day of (or before I can't remember) coming up with a ridiculous outfit for me from Value Village, and a cute one for her. I'll look back fondly on that night for the rest of my life. As we were getting our things ready in our vehicle a woman came up and asked us if we had a lighter, while Nicole rummaged to find hers to share the lady noted we made a cute pair and then asked if we were a couple. I looked over at Nicole and kind of went, I don't know, are we? I wish I could thank her for breaking the ice on that subject, because I'd been thinking it for a little bit. That night after the show while we were winding down for the evening at Nicoles place I asked her what she thought about what the stranger from earlier had asked. I then asked if she would be my girlfriend. While she didn't have an answer for me that night she thought on it and I'm glad she decided to make me her boyfriend. It's also the first pic I have of the two of us.</p>

        <h2>And Beyond</h2>
        <p>From here we started to date officially and have had many wonderful times together. Some of the notable adventures we've had were going to a Ruby Waters concert at K-Days, having Nicole be the slowest person on the track at Speeders, camping and calzones with Fraser and Megan, bean's birthday with Cooper and Coral, late night pizza shenanigans with the Brost Crew, Dark Edmonton with some of Nicoles friends, being aliens at Scream and having Nicole lose everything she was handed there, Little Shop of Horrors at the Citadel, and many, many more memories</p>
