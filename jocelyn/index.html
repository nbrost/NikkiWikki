        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Mrs. Applebottom, a 78-year-old widowed botanist, is a woman shrouded in mystery. Her backyard greenhouse is filled with exotic and peculiar plants, some of which are rumored to have sinister properties. After the unexpected death of her husband, Mrs. Applebottom found solace in her greenhouse, but her interest in botany took a dark turn.

            Whispers around town suggest that Mrs. Applebottom's plants are not just for show. Some believe she uses them to create potent potions and elixirs, while others fear that her greenhouse is home to dangerous, even deadly, specimens. Despite the rumors, Mrs. Applebottom remains a private and enigmatic figure, rarely seen outside of her property.
            
            Her vast knowledge of botany and her ability to cultivate even the most unusual plants have made her a subject of both admiration and suspicion. Some say that she has uncovered ancient secrets and uses her greenhouse to carry out forbidden experiments. The eerie glow that emanates from the greenhouse late at night only fuels the rumors surrounding her activities.
            
            As Mrs. Applebottom grows older, the mystery surrounding her only deepens. The town remains wary of the widow and her sinister greenhouse, but no one dares to confront her directly. The secrets she keeps hidden behind the glass walls of her botanical haven may never be fully revealed, but one thing is certain: Mrs. Applebottom is not just a simple widow with a green thumb.</p>

        <h2>Introduction Speech</h2>
        <p>Good evening, my dears. I am Mrs. Applebottom, a botanist with a lifelong passion for the extraordinary wonders of the plant world. At 78 years young, I have dedicated my life to cultivating and studying the most remarkable and unusual specimens in my beloved greenhouse.

            Since the untimely passing of my dear husband, my greenhouse has become my sanctuary, a place where I can lose myself in the beauty and mystery of nature. Some may whisper about the peculiar plants I grow, but pay no mind to idle gossip. My love for botany knows no bounds, and I am not afraid to push the limits of what is possible.
            
            In my greenhouse, you'll find a collection of rare and exotic plants, some with properties that may seem almost otherworldly. I have spent years uncovering the secrets of these botanical wonders, and I am always eager to discover more. The pursuit of knowledge is a thrilling endeavor, and I am not one to shy away from the unknown.
            
            Of course, my work is not for the faint of heart. The plants I cultivate are not merely decorative; they possess a power that few can comprehend. Some may even call them sinister, but I prefer to think of them as misunderstood. In the right hands, these plants can unlock the very secrets of life itself.
            
            So, if you find yourself drawn to the mysteries of the botanical world, do not hesitate to seek me out. I am always happy to share my knowledge with those who possess a keen mind and a brave heart. But be warned, my dears: once you step into my greenhouse, you may never see the world in quite the same way again.
