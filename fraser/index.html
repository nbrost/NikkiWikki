        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Big Tony R, a 52-year-old Italian-American, is the proud owner of a popular Italian restaurant and a thriving oyster farm. Born and raised in a tight-knit Italian community, Tony developed a deep appreciation for his heritage and a passion for traditional Italian cuisine from a young age.

            In his restaurant, Tony is known for his authentic, mouth-watering dishes, made with the freshest ingredients and a generous helping of love. His specialty is his homemade spaghetti, which he prepares using a secret family recipe passed down through generations.
            
            However, there's more to Big Tony than meets the eye. When he's not charming customers with his warm personality and delectable creations, he's known to engage in some shady dealings. Rumor has it that he's been slinging the "dankest oregano" out the back of his restaurant, catering to a more discreet clientele.
            
            Despite his questionable extracurricular activities, Big Tony remains a beloved figure in his community, known for his generous spirit and unwavering commitment to his family and friends. His larger-than-life presence and infectious laughter make him impossible to ignore, and his oyster farm provides the town with some of the freshest, most sought-after seafood in the region.</p>

        <h2>Introduction Speech</h2>
        <p>Bonasera, my friends! I'm Big Tony R, but you can just call me Tony. I'm 52 years young and damn proud of my Italian heritage. I own the best Italian restaurant in town, where I pour my heart and soul into every dish. My spaghetti is legendary, and I guarantee it'll make your taste buds sing like Pavarotti!

            When I'm not in the kitchen, you can find me tending to my oyster farm. I take pride in providing the freshest, most succulent oysters around. But let's be real, I'm not just a restaurant owner and oyster farmer. I've got a bit of a wild side, too. If you're ever in need of some, let's say, "special oregano," I might be able to hook you up. But you didn't hear that from me, capisce?
            
            I'm a family man at heart, and I believe in loyalty above all else. My friends and community mean everything to me, and I'll always go the extra mile for the people I care about. Life's too short not to enjoy the company of good people, great food, and maybe a little mischief here and there.
            
            So, that's me in a nutshell. I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you and sharing some unforgettable moments together. Salute!</p>
